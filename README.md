# Machine-Learning-Model-6
**Create Random Forests model for classification and regression and compare your results on train and test data**

* Download the the datasets is:
     * Bank Marketing Dataset (Classification, target = "bank term deposit") [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing]
     * U.S. Pollution Dataset (Regression, target = "CO AQI") [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sogun3/uspollution]
* Perform EDA on both datasets
* Create a Random Forest model for each dataset
* Report appropriate evaluation metrics for each model
* Compare the results of your models on the test data to the results on your train data and baseline models
